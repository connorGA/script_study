// JavaScript:
/*
 A high level, interpreted scripting language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web.
 JavaScript allows developers to implement complex features like interactive forms, animations, amnd real-time content updates.
 It is widely supported across all modern web browsers and can be used on both client side(in the browser) and the server side(using environments like Node.js)
*/

// TypeScript:
/*
 A supersett of JavaScript developed by Microsoft.
 It adds static typing, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript, enabling better tooling and the ability to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
 TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript, which can then be executed in any JavaScript environment.
 TypeScript is particularly popular in large-scale projects where maintainability, scalability, and reliability are critical

*/

// Similarities Between JavaScript and TypeScript:
/*
1. Syntax: TypeScript shares the same basic syntax as JavaScript, so JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. Makes it easy for JavaScript devs to transition to TypeScript
2. Execution Environment: Both TypeScript and JavaScript are ultimately executed as JavaScript in the browser or server(after Typescript is transpiled)
3. Ecosystem: TypeScript leverages the entire JavaScript ecosystem, meaning you can use all JavaScript libraries and frameworks with TypeScript 
*/

// Differences Between JavaScript and TypeScript:
/*
1. Static Typing: The most significant difference is that TypeScript introduces static types. 
                  You must declare the types of variables, function parameters, and return values in TypeScript, which helps catch errors at compile time
2. Type Inference: TypeScript includes type inference, meaning it can often automatically determine the type of variable without explicit annotations, thought you can still provide them
3. Compile-Time Error Checking: TypeScript checks for errors during the compilation process, which allows developers to catch potential issues before running the code
4. Advanced Features: TypeScript offers advanced features like interfaces, enums, and generics, which are not available in vanilla JavaScript
5. Tooling: TypeScript offers better tooling, especially in modern IDEs, due to the type information it provides.
            This results in features like auto-completion, type checking, and refactoring tools that are more powerful that those available for plain JavaScript
