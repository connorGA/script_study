// 1. Introduction to TypeScript
/*
TypeScript Basics:
    - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes all JavaScript features but adds optional static types, interfaces, and advanced language features that are absent in vanilla javascript
Type Annotations:
    -TypeScript allows you to define the type of a variable, function parameter, or a return value, making your code more predictable and easier to debug
*/
// Example:
let username: string = "John";
let age: number = 30;
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
/*
Compilation:
    - TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript, meaning you need to use a TypeScript compiler(e.g,'tsc') to convert .ts files in .js files
